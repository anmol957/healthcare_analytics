### Problem Statement:

XYZ a non-profit organization dedicated in making health conditions for working professionals better. XYZ was started because the founders saw their family suffer due to bad work life balance and neglected health.

XYZ organizes health camps in several cities with low work life balance. They reach out to working people and ask them to register for these health camps. For those who attend, XYZ provides them facility to undergo health checks or increase awareness by visiting various stalls (depending on the format of camp).

XYZ has conducted 65 such events over a period of 4 years and they see a high drop off between “Registration” and Number of people taking tests at the Camps. In last 4 years, they have stored data of ~110,000 registrations they have done.

#### The Process:
XYZ employees / volunteers reach out to people and drive registrations. During the camp, People who “ShowUp” either undergo the medical tests or visit stalls depending on the format of health camp.

#### Other things to note:
Since this is a completely voluntary activity for the working professionals, XYZ usually has little profile information about these people. For a few camps, there was hardware failure, so some information about date and time of registration is lost. XYZ runs 3 formats of these camps. The first and second format provides people with an instantaneous health score. The third format provides information about several health issues through various awareness stalls.

#### Favorable outcome:
For the first 2 formats, a favourable outcome is defined as getting a health_score, while in the third format it is defined as visiting at least a stall. You need to predict the chances (probability) of having a favourable outcome.

#### Train / Test split:
XYZ started on or before 31st March 2006 are considered in Train Test data is for all camps conducted on or after 1st April 2006.

#### Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric for this hackathon is ROC-AUC Score.
